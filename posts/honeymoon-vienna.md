description: We had our honeymoon in Vienna.
---

Four months after our wedding, Alex and I finally saved up enough money to go to Vienna, Austria. We originally wanted to go to Iceland, but decided against it because we weren't prepared to experience frigid Icelandic cold in the middle of winter. We also wanted to experience hot springs of some sort, so we also considered adding Austria's neighbour, Hungary to the itinerary. Alas, after spending a house deposits' worth of money on a wedding, we didn't have the budget for that either, so we settled with Vienna... And it was nice.

I didn't have many expectations before going there. I knew it was a country that was home to the likes of Mozart, Freud, and a little, angry man named Hitler (they don't mention that in the travel brochures, do they?). I also knew that they spoke a funny kind of German there, so it seemed natural for Alex to recommend the country. He's always keen to practise his German.

We stayed in Hietzing, Vienna, which is very close to the Botanical Garden and conveniently placed next to an underground station and tram lines. The air was cold – a sort of dry, bitter cold that contrasted with the UK's wet and grey winter weather. Thankfully, there was no sign of rain when we first arrived. It was quite sunny, in fact.

One of the first things we wanted to do was visit a Viennese Coffee House. Vienna has a lively café culture, where people are often seen reading a newspaper next to a cup of coffee on a marble tabletop. One of the most famous cafés is [Café Central](https://cafecentral.wien/en/), which opened in 1876 and became known for being a meeting place for intellectuals and influential politicians. The likes of Theodor Herzl, Alfred Adler, Sigmund Freud, Robert Musil, Leon Trotsky, Josef Stalin and, yes, Adolf Hitler were among many regulars in the café.

It is located in the Innere Stadt first district, which is now a popular tourist site. We had to wait in a twenty-minute queue to enter the café, which was actually quite fast considering the large amount of tourists there. As we waited, we had a pleasant view of baroque architecture and horse-drawn carriages clopping along the streets. The air also smelled of coffee, which was nice.

When we finally entered the café, I was taken aback by how high the ceilings were. Thick marble columns held them aloft, and it looked like it was painted with gold. The windows were tall and arched, and there was even a statue of Peter Altenberg to greet you at the door. This wasn't like your average, every-day Starbucks, and it wasn't an average café experience either.

Since it was one of our first meals in Austria, we had to try its famous national dish – Wiener Schnitzel. For those unaware, Wiener Schnitzel is a thin slice of breaded, pan-fried veal cutlet often served with boiled potatoes and a slice of lemon. It was good. What I was more impressed by, however, was the pumpkin soup. Yes, when you think of Austria, you don't tend to think, "I'll go there for the pumpkin soup" do you? Well, according to Alex's aunt in Germany, pumpkin soup is one of the must-have menu items when you visit Vienna. And she was right. I have never tasted pumpkin soup as good as the ones I've had during my trip there. It was fresh, and creamy, and thoroughly tasty. Of course, writing about food doesn't do it justice. You have to go there and experience it for yourself.

It soon occured to me, after exploring the rest of the city centre, that Café Central wasn't the only place with high-vaulted, gold-painted ceilings. Most of the darn city was like that. Vienna! Why are you so extra?? Ten minutes away from the café, there is a cathedral with striking patterns on its roof painted in gold. It's called St. Stephen's Cathedral, and it's the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna. Don't expect me to go into any more detail; all you need to know from me is that it was very pretty, and very big, and very cathedral-looking.

There are museums and restaurants and town squares all elaborately designed by gold-loving architects. We saw The Kiss by Gustav Klimt in the Belvedere Gallery, which is more striking to see in person because of the gold leaves used to decorate the figures' bodies.
